Released under the GPL License (https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).

You play as NahuiTochtli, an aztec hero who must fight against spanish conquistadors
in order to save Tenochtitlan and the Mexica Empire. You are not alone, aztec Gods are there to help you.

You can invoke Aztec Gods as you may find them on your way. Invoke the power of Huitzilopochtli, Quetzalcoatl,
Tlaloc, or any God that you find on your way.

Could you save all the codices before they are burned? Are you ready to fight against Cort√©s and his army?

NOTE:
This is the first version of this game. I am no designer, so I know this game really needs a facelift.


To play it (Pygame is required), just run the NT.py file:
